    <h1>Public Call for Volunteers: A Cross-cultural Idea</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Share Your Intuition on a Phrase - And See What Returns</div>

    <p>We are developing a new concept and need your raw, first impression. This is a quick, one-sentence task.</p>

    <p>We have a core phrase:</p>
    <div class="core-phrase">"Connect the dots, and see the river flow."</div>
    <p>We want to know what it means to you.</p>

    <p><strong>How to Participate:</strong></p>
    <p>If you are from Britain or America: Please reply with one sentence on how you understand this phrase.</p>
    <p>If you are from China: 请用中文告诉我们你对这句话的理解。如果能用成语来隐喻，则更为完美。</p>

    <p><strong>The Return (The Key Part):</strong> This is not a traditional reward. The insight and depth of your answer will determine the relevance and value of the content we send you next. A more thoughtful answer might unlock a more meaningful connection. Think of it as an intellectual key.</p>

    <p>We are looking for true understanding, not just words. We await your intuition.</p>
