    <h1>Public Call for Volunteers: A Cross-cultural Idea</h1>
    <p>Share Your Intuition on a Phrase - And See What Returns</p>
    <p>We are developing a new concept and need your raw, first impression.</p>
    <p>Core phrase: "Connect the dots, and see the river flow."</p>
    <p>We want to know what it means to you.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Participate:</strong></p>
    <p>If you are from Britain or America: Please reply with one sentence on how you understand this phrase.</p>
    <p>If you are from China: 请用中文告诉我们你对这句话的理解。如果能用成语来隐喻，则更为完美。</p>
    <p>We are looking for true understanding, not just words.</p>
